**GoogleSearch**

Test GoogleSearch

Test Case:

1. Go to the website http://google.com/ncr

2. Perform a search for "selenium"

3. It is expected that the first result in the issue leads to some page seleniumhq.org site.
If at the beginning of search results there were some widgets,
they are not taken into account (Wikipedia widget, the widget "Top stories", etc.)

4. Go to the "Images" tab

5. It is expected that the first picture in the issue in any way relates to the website seleniumhq.org

6. return to the "All" tab

7. It is expected that the first result still leads to the same page as in step 3.
